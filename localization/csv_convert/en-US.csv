Legacy.LegacyDialog.1,I hope a scrawny kid like you isn't all that is standing between us and Cthulhu's Eye.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.10,Check out my dirt blocks; they are extra dirty.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.100,Why purify the world when you can just blow it up?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.101,"If you throw this one in the bathtub and close all the windows, it'll clear your sinuses and pop your ears!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.102,Wanna play Fuse Chicken?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.103,"Hey, could you sign this Griefing Waiver?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.104,NO SMOKING IN HERE!!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.105,Explosives are da' bomb these days.  Buy some now!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.106,It's a good day to die!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.107,"I wonder what happens if I... (BOOM!)... Oh, sorry, did you need that leg?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.108,"Dynamite, my own special cure-all for what ails ya."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.109,Check out my goods; they have explosive prices!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.11,"Boy, that sun is hot! I do have some perfectly ventilated armor."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.110,I keep having vague memories of tying up a woman and throwing her in a dungeon.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.111,... we have a problem! It's a Blood Moon out there!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.112,"T'were I younger, I would ask {Nurse} out. I used to be quite the lady killer."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.113,That Red Hat of yours looks familiar...
Legacy.LegacyDialog.114,Thanks again for freeing me from my curse. Felt like something jumped up and bit me.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.115,Mama always said I would make a great tailor.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.116,Life's like a box of clothes; you never know what you are gonna wear!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.117,"Of course embroidery is hard! If it wasn't hard, no one would do it! That's what makes it great."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.118,I know everything they is to know about the clothierin' business.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.119,"Being cursed was lonely, so I once made a friend out of leather. I named him Wilson."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.12,"The sun is high, but my prices are not."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.120,"Thank you for freeing me, human.  I was tied up and left here by the other goblins.  You could say that we didn't get along very well."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.121,I can't believe they tied me up and left me here just for pointing out that they weren't going east!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.122,"Now that I'm an outcast, can I throw away the spiked balls? My pockets hurt."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.123,Looking for a gadgets expert? I'm your goblin!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.124,"Thanks for your help. Now, I have to finish pacing around aimlessly here. I'm sure we'll meet again."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.125,I thought you'd be taller.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.126,"Hey...what's {Mechanic} up to? Have you...have you talked to her, by chance?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.127,"Hey, does your hat need a motor? I think I have a motor that would fit exactly in that hat."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.128,"Yo, I heard you like rockets and running boots, so I put some rockets in your running boots."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.129,Silence is golden. Duct tape is silver.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.13,"Oh, great. I can hear {Mechanic} and {Nurse} arguing from here."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.130,"YES, gold is stronger than iron. What are they teaching these humans nowadays?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.131,"You know, that mining helmet-flipper combination was a much better idea on paper."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.132,"Goblins are surprisingly easy to anger. In fact, they could start a war over cloth!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.133,"To be honest, most goblins aren't exactly rocket scientists. Well, some are."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.134,Do you know why we all carry around these spiked balls? Because I don't.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.135,I just finished my newest creation! This version doesn't explode violently if you breathe on it too hard.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.136,Goblin thieves aren't very good at their job. They can't even steal from an unlocked chest!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.137,"Thanks for saving me, friend!  This bondage was starting to chafe."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.138,"Ohh, my hero!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.139,"Oh, how heroic! Thank you for saving me, young lady!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.14,Have you seen Chith...Shith.. Chat... The big eye?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.140,"Oh, how heroic! Thank you for saving me, young man!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.141,"Now that we know each other, I can move in with you, right?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.142,"Well, hi there, {Guide}! What can I do for you today?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.143,"Well, hi there, {Demolitionist}! What can I do for you today?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.144,"Well, hi there, {GoblinTinkerer}! What can I do for you today?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.145,"Well, hi there, {Nurse}! What can I do for you today?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.146,"Well, hi there, {Mechanic}! What can I do for you today?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.147,"Well, hi there, {Dryad}! What can I do for you today?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.148,Want me to pull a coin from behind your ear? No? Ok.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.149,Do you want some magic candy? No? Ok.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.15,"Hey, this house is secure, right? Right? {PlayerName}?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.150,I make a rather enchanting hot chocolate if you'd be inter...No? Ok.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.151,Are you here for a peek at my crystal ball?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.152,Ever wanted an enchanted ring that turns rocks into slimes? Well neither did I.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.153,Someone once told me friendship is magic. That's ridiculous. You can't turn people into frogs with friendship.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.154,I can see your future now... You will buy a lot of items from me!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.155,I once tried to bring an Angel Statue to life. It didn't do anything.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.156,Thanks!  It was just a matter of time before I ended up like the rest of the skeletons down here.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.157,"Hey, watch where you're going! I was over there a little while ago!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.158,"Hold on, I've almost got wifi going down here."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.159,But I was almost done putting blinking lights up here!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.16,Not even a Blood Moon can stop capitalism. Let's do some business.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.160,DON'T MOVE. I DROPPED MY CONTACT.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.161,All I want is for the switch to make the... What?!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.162,"Oh, let me guess. Didn't buy enough wire. Idiot."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.163,Just-could you just... Please? Ok? Ok. Ugh.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.164,I don't appreciate the way you're looking at me. I am WORKING right now.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.165,"Hey, {PlayerName}, did you just come from {GoblinTinkerer}'s? Did he say anything about me by chance?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.166,{ArmsDealer} keeps talking about pressing my pressure plate. I told him it was for stepping on.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.167,Always buy more wire than you need!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.168,Did you make sure your device was plugged in?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.169,"Oh, you know what this house needs? More blinking lights."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.17,"Keep your eye on the prize, buy a lens!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.170,You can tell a Blood Moon is out when the sky turns red. There is something about it that causes monsters to swarm.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.171,"Hey, buddy, do you know where any deathweed is? Oh, no reason; just wondering, is all."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.172,"If you were to look up, you'd see that the moon is red right now."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.173,You should stay indoors at night. It is very dangerous to be wandering around in the dark.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.174,"Greetings, {PlayerName}. Is there something I can help you with?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.175,I am here to give you advice on what to do next.  It is recommended that you talk with me anytime you get stuck.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.176,They say there is a person who will tell you how to survive in this land... oh wait. That's me.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.177,"You can use your pickaxe to dig through dirt, and your axe to chop down trees. Just place your cursor over the tile and click!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.178,"If you want to survive, you will need to create weapons and shelter. Start by chopping down trees and gathering wood."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.179,"Press {InventoryKey} to access your crafting menu. When you have enough wood, create a workbench. This will allow you to create more complicated things, as long as you are standing close to it."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.18,"Kosh, kapleck Mog. Oh sorry, that's klingon for 'Buy something or die.'"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.180,You can build a shelter by placing wood or other blocks in the world. Don't forget to create and place walls.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.181,"Once you have a wooden sword, you might try to gather some gel from the slimes. Combine wood and gel to make a torch!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.182,"To interact with backgrounds, use a hammer!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.183,You should do some mining to find metal ore. You can craft very useful things with it.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.184,"Now that you have some ore, you will need to turn it into a bar in order to make items with it. This requires a furnace!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.185,"You can create a furnace out of torches, wood, and stone. Make sure you are standing near a work bench."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.186,You will need an anvil to make most things out of metal bars.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.187,"Anvils can be crafted out of iron or lead, or purchased from a merchant."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.188,Underground are crystal hearts which can be used to increase your max life. You can smash them with a pickaxe.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.189,"If you gather 5 fallen stars, they can be combined to create an item that will increase your magic capacity."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.19,"{PlayerName} is it? I've heard good things, friend!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.190,"Stars fall all over the world at night. They can be used for all sorts of useful things. If you see one, be sure to grab it because they disappear after sunrise."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.191,There are many different ways you can attract people to move in to our town. They will of course need a home to live in.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.192,"In order for a room to be considered a home, it needs to have a door, a chair, a table, and a light source.  Make sure the house has walls as well."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.193,"Two people will not live in the same home. Also, if their home is destroyed, they will look for a new place to live."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.194,You can use the housing interface to assign and view housing. Open your inventory and click the house icon.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.195,"If you want a merchant to move in, you will need to gather plenty of money. 50 silver coins should do the trick!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.196,"For a nurse to move in, you might want to increase your maximum life."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.197,"If you had a gun, I bet an arms dealer might show up to sell you some ammo!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.198,You should prove yourself by defeating a strong monster. That will get the attention of a dryad.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.199,Make sure to explore the dungeon thoroughly. There may be prisoners held deep within.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.2,Look at that shoddy armor you're wearing. Better buy some more healing potions.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.20,I hear there's a secret treasure... oh never mind.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.200,Perhaps the old man by the dungeon would like to join us now that his curse has been lifted.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.201,Hang on to any bombs you might find. A demolitionist may want to have a look at them.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.202,Are goblins really so different from us that we couldn't live together peacefully?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.203,I heard there was a powerful wizard who lives in these parts.  Make sure to keep an eye out for him next time you go underground.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.204,"If you combine lenses at a demon altar, you might be able to find a way to summon a powerful monster. You will want to wait until night before using it, though."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.205,You can create worm bait with rotten chunks and vile powder. Make sure you are in a corrupt area before using it.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.206,Demonic altars can usually be found in the corruption. You will need to be near them to craft some items.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.207,"You can make a grappling hook from a hook and 3 chains. Skeletons found deep underground usually carry hooks, and chains can be made from iron bars or lead bars."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.208,"If you see a pot, be sure to smash it open. They contain all sorts of useful supplies."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.209,There is treasure hidden all over the world. Some amazing things can be found deep underground!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.21,"Angel Statue you say? I'm sorry, I'm not a junk dealer."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.210,Shadow orbs can usually be found in the chasms around corrupt areas. Smashing too many will unleash the Eater of Worlds. Defeating this foe may cause meteors to fall out of the sky!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.211,You should focus on gathering more life crystals to increase your maximum life.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.212,Your current equipment simply won't do. You need to make better armor.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.213,I think you are ready for your first major battle. Gather some lenses from the eyeballs at night and take them to a demon altar.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.214,You will want to increase your life before facing your next challenge. Fifteen hearts should be enough.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.215,"The ebonstone in the corruption can be purified using some powder from a dryad, or it can be destroyed with explosives."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.216,Your next step should be to explore the corrupt chasms.  Destroy any shadow orb you find.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.217,There is an old dungeon not far from here. Now would be a good time to go check it out.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.218,You should make an attempt to max out your available life. Try to gather twenty hearts.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.219,"There are many treasures to be discovered in the jungle, if you are willing to dig deep enough."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.22,The last guy who was here left me some junk... er I mean... treasures!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.220,The underworld is made of a material called hellstone. It's perfect for making weapons and armor.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.221,"When you are ready to challenge the keeper of the underworld, you will have to make a living sacrifice. Everything you need for it can be found in the underworld."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.222,Make sure to smash any demon altar you can find. Something good is bound to happen if you do!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.223,Souls can sometimes be gathered from fallen creatures in places of extreme light or dark.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.224,"Ho ho ho, and a bottle of... Egg Nog!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.225,Care to bake me some cookies?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.226,What? You thought I wasn't real?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.227,I managed to sew your face back on. Be more careful next time.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.228,That's probably going to leave a scar.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.229,All better. I don't want to see you jumping off anymore cliffs.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.23,"I wonder if the moon is made of cheese...huh, what? Oh yes, buy something!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.230,"That didn't hurt too bad, now did it?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.231,"As if living underground wasn't bad enough, jerks like you come in while I'm sleeping and steal my children."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.232,"Between you and me, {Dryad} is the only one I trust. She is the only one here who hasn't tried to eat me or use me in a potion."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.233,"I tried to lick myself the other day to see what the big deal was, everything started glowing blue."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.234,"Everytime I see the color blue, it makes me depressed and lazy."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.235,You haven't seen any pigs around here have you? My brother lost his leg to one.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.236,Everyone in this town feels a bit off. I woke up to the clothier chewing on my foot last night.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.237,I'll give you a discount on your wears if you can convince {Truffle} to come over for a...sizing.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.238,"I feel like {Truffle} is a bit misunderstood, he really is a fun guy."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.24,Did you say gold?  I'll take that off of ya.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.240,"I don't know the 'Truffle Shuffle,' so stop asking!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.241,"There's been such a huge rumor that's being spread about me, 'If you can't beat him, eat him!'"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.242,"Oy, whatchu got in you jiminy fluffer?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.243,Should I become an air pirate? I've considered becoming an air pirate.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.244,"Be it what it would, a jetpack would suit you nicely!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.245,"I'm feeling a bit peevish as of late, so enough with your palaver you ragamuffin!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.246,I'm mighty curious about that {Cyborg} fellow. By what manner of consumption does he maintain such locomotion?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.247,That captain fellow seems to me to be 'pretty well over the bay' if you know what I mean!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.248,Show me some gears!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.249,I like your... gear. Does it come in brass?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.25,You better not get blood on me.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.250,"Once you enter hallowed land, you will see a rainbow in the sky. I can help you with painting that if you want."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.251,Check out {PartyGirl}. Now that's a girl who can paint the town red!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.252,I know the difference between turquoise and blue-green. But I won't tell you.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.253,"I'm all out of titanium white, so don't even ask."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.254,"Try swirly pink and purple, it works, I swear!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.255,"No, no, no... There's TONS of different grays! Don't get me started..."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.256,I hope it doesn't rain again until this paint dries. That would be a disaster!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.257,I bring you the richest colors in exchange for your riches!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.258,"My dear, what you're wearing is much too drab. You absolutely must take a lesson in dyeing your tired attire!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.259,The only kind of wood I would bother dyeing is RICH Mahogany. Dyeing any other wood is such a waste.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.26,Hurry up and stop bleeding.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.260,"You must do something about {Pirate}.  Everytime he comes over here, it takes me a week to get the smell off!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.261,Which doctor am I? The Witch Doctor am I.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.262,The heart of magic is nature. The nature of hearts is magic.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.263,"{Nurse} may help heal your body, but I can make you embody healing."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.264,"Choose wisely, {PlayerName}, my commodities are volatile and my dark arts, mysterious."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.265,We have to talk. It's... it's about parties.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.266,"I can't decide what I like more: parties, or after-parties."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.267,"We should set up a blinkroot party, and we should also set up an after-party."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.268,"Wow, {PlayerName}, meeting an adventurous man like you makes me want to party!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.269,Put up a disco ball and then I'll show you how to party.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.27,"If you're going to die, do it outside."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.270,"I went to Sweden once, they party hard, why aren't you like that?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.271,"My name's {PartyGirl} but people call me party pooper. Yeah I don't know, it sounds cool though."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.272,"Do you party? Sometimes? Hm, okay then we can talk..."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.273,"I'm no landlubber, but it's better to have lubbed and lost than never to have lubbed at all."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.274,Yo ho ho and a bottle of....blinkroots!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.275,YAR!  Funny ye should be mentionin' parrots b'cause...um...What t'were we talkin' 'bout?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.276,"{PlayerName}, Ye be one o' the finest lookin' lassies this here captain's seen in many a fortnight!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.277,"Stay off me booty, ya scallywag!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.278,What in blazes are ye talkin' about? Moby Dick is mine!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.279,*Yarr Blarr Harrdarr*
Legacy.LegacyDialog.28,What is that supposed to mean?!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.280,"And then Unit 492-8 said, 'Who do you think I am, Unit 472-6?' HA. HA. HA."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.281,My expedition efficiency was critically reduced when a projectile impacted my locomotive actuator.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.282,"This sentence is false, or is it?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.283,"So that 'punk' lookin' chick is an inventor, eh? I think I could show her a thing or two!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.284,"Sure, me and {Pirate} are pals, but I hate it when his parrot does his business on me. That stuff's corrosive!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.285,"I built myself a taste mechanism, so I can drink some ale!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.286,Sometimes I come off a bit... Get it? a bit?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.287,Short back and sides' is it?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.288,Those highlights really bring out your eyes!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.289,My hands are sticky from all that... wax.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.29,I don't think I like your tone.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.290,Tea? Coffee? Or is it just orange juice again?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.291,"Doll, we seriously need to fix those split ends."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.292,Gurrllll! You are my favorite gossip ever.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.293,"Which aftershave can I interest you in today, sir?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.294,Sit down for a second and I'll have you steppin' razor.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.295,"Either you have style, or you get styled."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.296,For you I think we'll do something... low maintenance.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.297,I tried using one of the Dye Master's products once. Ends fried. Disaster.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.298,"Oh you poor, poor thing. Just... just sit down here. It'll be okay. Shhhh."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.299,Check my fresh.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.3,I feel like an evil presence is watching me.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.30,"Why are you even here? If you aren't bleeding, you don't need to be here. Get out."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.300,"Hello sir, I'm {Stylist}, and I'll be your barber today."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.301,Just a little off the top?  That's no fun...
Legacy.LegacyDialog.302,I hope you like what I did to {PartyGirl}'s hair!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.303,There is nothing I can do for {Demolitionist}'s singed head. He's a lost cause.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.304,"Tipping IS optional, but remember I have access to scissors and your head."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.305,This is a cut-throat razor by the way.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.306,"You better stay outta my hair tonight, hun. I just sharpened my scissors, and I'm looking for an excuse to use them!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.307,"Mhmm, I heard from {PartyGirl} that {Mechanic}'s friend {Nurse} spent her boyfriend's last paycheck on shoes."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.308,One time I put a wig on {Cyborg} just so I could cut his hair. I think he kinda liked it!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.309,I tried to visit {Stylist} one time. She just looked at me and said 'nope.'
Legacy.LegacyDialog.31,WHAT?!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.310,I think it is about time I got my hair did!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.311,Did you even try to brush your hair today?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.312,"So a pixie cut, would you like to keep some lady burns?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.313,"I have no problem cleaning up ears and eyebrows, but I draw the line at nose hair."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.314,"Alright, you sit and marinate. I'll be back to rinse your color out in 25 minutes..."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.315,Thanks hun! Now I can finally do my hair.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.316,I would have given you a free cut if you'd come earlier.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.317,"Don't go exploring with scissors, they said. You won't get trapped in a spider's web, they said!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.318,"Ew, my hair, there's spider web all over it!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.319,"Meet me behind {Guide}'s house in about three hours, I think I have something you will find very appealing."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.32,Have you seen that old man pacing around the dungeon? He looks troubled.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.320,"That {Merchant}, he really has no appreciation for a really good deal."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.321,I sell only what I can get. {Clothier} keeps hounding me for exotic clothing.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.322,"Hmm, you look like you could use an Angel Statue! They slice, and dice, and make everything nice!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.323,"I don't refund for ""buyer's remorse..."" Or for any other reason, really."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.324,Buy now and get free shipping!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.325,I sell wares from places that might not even exist!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.326,You want two penny farthings!? Make it one and we have a deal.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.327,Combination hookah and coffee maker! Also makes julienne fries!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.328,"Come and have a look! One pound fish! Very, very good! One pound fish!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.329,"If you're looking for junk, you've come to the wrong place."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.33,I wish {Demolitionist} would be more careful.  I'm getting tired of having to sew his limbs back on every day.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.330,"A thrift shop?  No, I am only selling the highest quality items on the market."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.331,Crimson hearts can usually be found in the chasms around crimson areas. Smashing too many will unleash the Brain of Cthulhu. Defeating this foe may cause meteors to fall out of the sky!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.332,Have you tried using purification powder on the crimstone of the crimson?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.333,You must cleanse the world of this crimson.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.334,"Psst! I might have a job for you. Don't think you can say no, either!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.335,I want a fish and you're going to find me one! Ask me about it!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.336,Hey! Just the sacrifi- I mean competent fishing master that I've been looking for! 
Legacy.LegacyDialog.337,{Angler} wants YOU as the official {WorldName} errand monkey!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.338,Whaaaat?! Can't you see I'm winding up fishing line??
Legacy.LegacyDialog.339,I have enough fish! I don't need your help right now!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.34,"Hey, has {ArmsDealer} mentioned needing to go to the doctor for any reason? Just wondering."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.340,"There's no chefs in all of {WorldName}, so I have to cook all this fish myself! "
Legacy.LegacyDialog.341,Hey! Watch it! I'm setting up traps for my biggest prank ever! No one will see it coming! Don't you dare tell anyone!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.342,"Let a kid give you some advice, never touch your tongue to an ice block! Wait, forget what I said, I totally want to see you do it!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.343,"Ever heard of a barking fish?! I haven't, I'm just wondering if you did!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.344,{WorldName} is filled to the brim with the most outlandish kinds of fish!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.345,"I'm bummed out! There's probably been fish that have gone extinct before I even was born, and that's not fair!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.346,"I don't have a mommy or a daddy, but I have a lot of fish! It's close enough!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.347,"Heh heh, you shoulda seen the look on {Dryad}'s face when I stuck that piranha tooth in the chair!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.348,"I have a request for you! No, I don't care that there's a zombie apocalypse right now!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.349,Hurry up and listen! I need you to catch something for me right now!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.35,I need to have a serious talk with {Guide}. How many times a week can you come in with severe lava burns?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.350,I hate Blood Moons! I stay up all night because of all the scary noises!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.351,"Blood Moon is the worst time to fish! The fish bite, yes, but so do the zombies!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.352,There's a bajillion monsters running around out there right now!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.353,"Thanks, I guess, for saving me or whatever. You'd be a great helper minion!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.354,Wha? Who might you be? I totally wasn't just drowning or anything!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.355,"You saved me! You're awful nice, I could use you... er, I mean, totally hire you to do some awesome stuff for me!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.356,Got any spare bones for sale? I'm looking to replace my broken hip... again.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.357,Excellent! Someone's finally come by to take some of these maggots off my hands.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.358,"There's no illness or condition that can't be cured by some of my Slime Oil! Trust me, it works, just look at my lively figure!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.359,"You've got a real backbone coming way down here, how 'bout ya buy somethin?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.36,I think you look better this way.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.360,You would not believe some of the things people throw at me... Wanna buy some of it?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.361,"I'd lend you a hand, but last time I did that, I didn't get it back for a month."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.362,Stay away from the spiders. They'll suck out your insides and leave you a hollow shell of a man. Trust me on this one.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.363,"The only things constant in this world are death and taxes, I've got both!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.364,You again? Suppose you want more money!?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.365,Must everyone open and shut doors so incredibly noisily around here?!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.366,"I see you're free of time, as usual. Can't imagine what work life would be for your kind of folk."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.367,"Yes, yes, yes! -- I'll give you your share in just a moment. I'd think you to be a bit more patient, what with me doing all the work and all."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.368,What does a man have to do to be left alone in this place? Go bugger someone less busy!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.369,"...two barrels of molasses, plus -- Oh, nevermind that, you're here. Here's your money."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.37,Eww... What happened to your face?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.370,Just between you and me... I have no idea why they're bothering to pay the rent
Legacy.LegacyDialog.371,"Tried to get {Dryad} to pay me with favors once, now I have fungus growing in strange places."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.372,"Go tell {ArmsDealer} to stop offering to pay me with ammo, I don't even own a gun."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.373,Why don't YOU try collecting money from {Demolitionist} and not lose a hand or foot or...
Legacy.LegacyDialog.374,I just came from {Merchant}'s. He wanted to know if I took credit cards.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.38,"MY GOODNESS! I'm good, but I'm not THAT good."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.380,Here's your cut of the taxes that I've taken from our surplus population!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.381,"Here you are again, taking all my coin! Just grab it and begone from my sight!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.382,"Bah! Here, take your shillings and get out of my sight!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.383,"This is all you're gonna get for now, not a penny more! Take it and spend it wisely."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.39,"Dear friends we are gathered here today to bid farewell... Oh, you'll be fine."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.390,"...And people call me greedy? No, I have nothing else for you."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.391,"Oh, so you just see me as a coin sign, eh? 'Cus every time you see me, you ask me."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.392,Don't you ever stop just to say 'Hi?'
Legacy.LegacyDialog.393,"Bah! You again? You just grabbed some of my coin just moments ago, so bugger off and come back later!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.394,I just gave you half a crown five minutes ago! Scram!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.395,Reaching into my moneybags again already!? And you call ME greedy.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.396,"You just received your pay, and not a farthing more! Get out!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.397,"Money doesn't grow on trees, so don't overpick my fruit! Bah! "
Legacy.LegacyDialog.398,"You already managed to spend every pence I paid you!? Bah, I'm not a charity, go kill a slime!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.399,"Not so fast! You got your money, now begone! "
Legacy.LegacyDialog.4,Sword beats paper! Get one today.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.40,You left your arm over there. Let me get that for you...
Legacy.LegacyDialog.400,Begging so soon?! Don't look at me like I'll have a change of heart overnight! 
Legacy.LegacyDialog.401,Make sure to smash any crimson altar you can find. Something good is bound to happen if you do!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.402,Crimson altars can usually be found in the crimson. You will need to be near them to craft some items.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.403,You can create a bloody spine with vertebrae. Make sure you are in a crimson area before using it.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.404,I think you are ready for your first major battle. Gather some lenses from the eyeballs at night and take them to a crimson altar.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.41,Quit being such a baby! I've seen worse.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.42,That's gonna need stitches!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.43,Trouble with those bullies again?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.44,"Hold on, I've got some cartoon bandages around here somewhere."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.45,"Walk it off, {PlayerName}, you'll be fine. Sheesh."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.46,Does it hurt when you do that? Don't do that.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.47,You look half digested. Have you been chasing slimes again?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.48,Turn your head and cough.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.49,"That's not the biggest I've ever seen... Yes, I've seen bigger wounds for sure."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.5,You want apples? You want carrots? You want pineapples? We got torches.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.50,Would you like a lollipop?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.51,Show me where it hurts.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.52,"I'm sorry, but you can't afford me."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.53,I'm gonna need more gold than that.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.54,I don't work for free you know.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.55,I don't give happy endings.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.56,I can't do anymore for you without plastic surgery.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.57,Quit wasting my time.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.58,I heard there is a doll that looks very similar to {Guide} somewhere in the underworld.  I'd like to put a few rounds in it.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.59,Make it quick! I've got a date with {Nurse} in an hour.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.6,"Lovely morning, wouldn't you say? Was there something you needed?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.60,"I want what {Nurse} is sellin'. What do you mean, she doesn't sell anything?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.61,{Dryad} is a looker.  Too bad she's such a prude.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.62,"Don't bother with {Demolitionist}, I've got all you need right here."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.63,What's {Demolitionist}'s problem? Does he even realize we sell completely different stuff?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.64,"Man, it's a good night not to talk to anybody, don't you think, {PlayerName}?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.65,I love nights like tonight.  There is never a shortage of things to kill!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.66,I see you're eyeballin' the Minishark.. You really don't want to know how it was made.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.67,"Hey, this ain't a movie, pal. Ammo is extra."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.68,"Keep your hands off my gun, buddy!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.69,Have you tried using purification powder on the ebonstone of the corruption?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.7,"Night will be upon us soon, friend. Make your choices while you can."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.70,I wish {ArmsDealer} would stop flirting with me. Doesn't he realize I'm 500 years old?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.71,Why does {Merchant} keep trying to sell me angel statues? Everyone knows that they don't do anything.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.72,Have you seen the old man walking around the dungeon? He doesn't look well at all...
Legacy.LegacyDialog.73,"I sell what I want! If you don't like it, too bad."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.74,Why do you have to be so confrontational during a time like this?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.75,"I don't want you to buy my stuff. I want you to want to buy my stuff, ok?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.76,"Dude, is it just me or is there like a million zombies out tonight?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.77,You must cleanse the world of this corruption.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.78,Be safe; Terraria needs you!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.79,"The sands of time are flowing. And well, you are not aging very gracefully."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.8,You have no idea how much Dirt Blocks sell for overseas.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.80,What's this about me having more 'bark' than bite?
Legacy.LegacyDialog.81,"So two goblins walk into a bar, and one says to the other, 'Want to get a Goblet of beer?!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.82,I cannot let you enter until you free me of my curse.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.83,Come back at night if you wish to enter.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.84,My master cannot be summoned under the light of day.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.85,You are far too weak to defeat my curse.  Come back when you aren't so worthless.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.86,You pathetic fool.  You cannot hope to face my master as you are now.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.87,I hope you have like six friends standing around behind you.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.88,"Please, no, stranger. You'll only get yourself killed."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.89,You just might be strong enough to free me from my curse...
Legacy.LegacyDialog.9,"Ah, they will tell tales of {PlayerName} some day... good ones I'm sure."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.90,"Stranger, do you possess the strength to defeat my master?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.91,Please! Battle my captor and free me! I beg you!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.92,"Defeat my master, and I will grant you passage into the Dungeon."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.93,"Trying to get past that {WorldEvilStone}, eh? Why not introduce it to one of these explosives!"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.94,"Hey, have you seen a clown around?"
Legacy.LegacyDialog.95,"There was a bomb sitting right here, and now I can't seem to find it..."
Legacy.LegacyDialog.96,I've got something for them zombies alright!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.97,Even {ArmsDealer} wants what I'm selling!
Legacy.LegacyDialog.98,Would you rather have a bullet hole or a grenade hole? That's what I thought.
Legacy.LegacyDialog.99,I'm sure {Nurse} will help if you accidentally lose a limb to these.

Town.GolferChatter.Chatter_8,"When I offer you to go clubbing, I don't mean downtown. I mean like, with a five iron?"

Town.PrincessChatter.Chatter_14,"I'm so happy to finally travel the world, and meet new people!"

Town.AnglerQuestText.Quest_Bunnyfish,"Out in the forest, I was fishing right? Well guess what! A bunny hopped up to me! Then another one hopped up, and another... suddenly I'm surrounded by bunnies!

(Caught in Ocean)"

(Caught in Corruption)"
Town.AnglerQuestText.Quest_Mudfish,"Watch your step when wading through jungle waters! Why? No, not because I care about you being eaten by piranhas. I care because you'll step on one of my favorite kinds of fish, the Mud Fish! I also care a lot that you're going to grab me one as a pet!

(Caught in Jungle)"
Town.AnglerQuestText.Quest_TropicalBarracuda,"Piranhas and sharks are ugly! Soooo ugly! Did you know there's a fish that looks very pretty and still can eat your face off?

Town.PirateChatter.Chatter_1,About time we gotta barkeep around here! Me rum was almost gone!
Town.GuideChatter.Chatter_1,I thought you said you purified {TaxCollector}? He's just as greedy as ever!
Town.GuideChatter.Chatter_2,I wonder why my predecessor spontaneously burst into flames. Hopefully it doesn't happen to me...
Town.NurseChatter.Chatter_1,"I keep asking for wine, but all {Bartender} gives me are mugs of ale."
Town.StylistChatter.Chatter_1,"I offered {Bartender} a free trim, but he refused. I mean, I could have at least worked on his mustache!"
Town.CyborgChatter.Chatter_1,"{Bartender} said I reminded him of a certain ""EV2"". Perhaps I should meet her."
Town.MechanicChatter.Chatter_1,"{Bartender} offered me a Root Beer, I told him to give it to me in a square cup."
Town.AnglerChatter.Chatter_1,How come {Bartender} won't sell me any ale? I want to try some! What a grouch!
Town.AnglerChatter.Chatter_2,Whaaaat?! Can't you see I'm winding up fishing line??
Town.AnglerChatter.Chatter_3,I have enough fish! I don't need your help right now!
Town.AnglerChatter.Chatter_4,"There's no chefs in all of {WorldName}, so I have to cook all this fish myself! "
Town.AnglerChatter.Chatter_5,Hey! Watch it! I'm setting up traps for my biggest prank ever! No one will see it coming! Don't you dare tell anyone!
Town.AnglerChatter.Chatter_6,"Let a kid give you some advice, never touch your tongue to an ice block! Wait, forget what I said, I totally want to see you do it!"
Town.AnglerChatter.Chatter_7,"Ever heard of a barking fish?! I haven't, I'm just wondering if you did!"
Town.AnglerChatter.Chatter_8,{WorldName} is filled to the brim with the most outlandish kinds of fish!
Town.AnglerChatter.Chatter_9,"I'm bummed out! There's probably been fish that have gone extinct before I even was born, and that's not fair!"
Town.AnglerChatter.Chatter_10,"I don't have a mommy or a daddy, but I have a lot of fish! It's close enough!"
Town.GoblinTinkererChatter.Chatter_1,"You know, these Etherian Goblins are nothing like my people. Really rowdy bunch. Not that my people are much better..."
Town.MerchantSpecialText.Party,"You know what would be the best way to party? Buying things for others, specifically from me."
Town.MerchantSpecialText.Graveyard1,This eerie atmosphere is bad for business!
Town.MerchantSpecialText.Graveyard2,This is a terrible location... I can't sell my wares to the dead!
Town.MerchantSpecialText.Windy1,"What a blustery day! Stay awhile, and buy a thing or two."
Town.MerchantSpecialText.Windy2,I used slime glue to keep my hat from blowing away! Perhaps I can sell you some for a couple gold coins...
Town.MerchantSpecialText.Storm1,"Wanna buy a lightning rod? Oh, seems I'm out of stock."
Town.MerchantSpecialText.Storm2,Storms rollin' in... how 'bout you come in and buy something?
Town.MerchantSpecialText.Rain1,Umbrellas! Umbrellas! Get your half-off umbrellas!
Town.MerchantSpecialText.Rain2,How dreary! Lighten the mood with 99 torches!
Town.NurseSpecialText.Party,"No, I will not tell you how many candles are on my cake."
Town.NurseSpecialText.Graveyard1,Ahh!! I'd rather be working at an abandoned hospital than hanging around here!
Town.NurseSpecialText.Graveyard2,"This place creeps me out, and I can't treat dead patients!"
Town.NurseSpecialText.Windy1,This breeze is really extra right now! Beware of flying needles.
Town.NurseSpecialText.Windy2,I've been chasing my medical instruments all day. This gale is keeping me fit!
Town.NurseSpecialText.Storm1,"I do not perform shock therapy, just go stand outside under a tree!"
Town.NurseSpecialText.Storm2,Just stay inside! I've already treated too many electrocuted patients today.

Town.NurseSpecialText.Rain2,Great! Now my uniform is all wet. Stop staring!
Town.NurseSpecialText.DeathCountLow,"What, you again?! Feels like I see you a lot, let me check your chart... Yep, you've been slain {TotalDeathsCount} times."

Town.NurseSpecialText.DeathCountHigh,"Wow, you have been defeated {TotalDeathsCount} times? Have you ever considered a change of profession? Maybe take up farming?"
Town.ArmsDealerSpecialText.Party,"Parties are great for getting people to come out of their shell, just like with bullets."
Town.ArmsDealerSpecialText.Graveyard1,I hate places like this. I can't kill what's already dead!
Town.ArmsDealerSpecialText.Graveyard2,"If you see any suspicious activity out in that fog, I wasn't involved."
Town.ArmsDealerSpecialText.Windy1,"Was tryin' out my new gun, but the wind kept me off target!"
Town.ArmsDealerSpecialText.Windy2,"Don't spray and pray in the wind, buddy!"
Town.ArmsDealerSpecialText.Storm1,"A lightning gun? Don't have time for that, man. I love my bullets!"
Town.ArmsDealerSpecialText.Storm2,"If you time it right, no one will hear your gunshots with the thunder."
Town.ArmsDealerSpecialText.Rain1,Heard a rumor that some clouds are literally out to get you! Show 'em who's boss with one of my guns!
Town.ArmsDealerSpecialText.Rain2,Flying fish? I call that target practice!
Town.DryadSpecialText.AfterDD2Tier1,"When I was in Etheria, I felt so disconnected from {WorldName}. It's good to be back."

Town.DryadSpecialText.WorldDescriptionGrim,Things are grim indeed...
Town.DryadSpecialText.WorldDescriptionWork,You have a lot of work to do.
Town.DryadSpecialText.WorldDescriptionClose,You are so close!
Town.DryadSpecialText.Party,I thought I would throw a party to celebrate our victories in the past and those yet to come.
Town.DryadSpecialText.Graveyard1,"I can handle the corruption, but the vile air of death in this location wilts the flower in my hair."
Town.DryadSpecialText.Graveyard2,This place... I can hear the cry of nature at those who've fallen here.
Town.DryadSpecialText.Windy1,The wind... it is nature's way of sweeping the dust from the land.
Town.DryadSpecialText.Windy2,Nature's fury strips the leaves from the trees this day.
Town.DryadSpecialText.Storm1,"Our mother is angry, and wishes to burn away the filth by raining destructive power on our treetops."
Town.DryadSpecialText.Storm2,It is unwise to traverse openly beneath the flashing dangers from above.
Town.DryadSpecialText.Rain1,The water from the sky is a way for nature to wash away the mud in our streams.
Town.DryadSpecialText.Rain2,"When it rains, many kinds of fish acquire mystical properties."
Town.GuideSpecialText.Party,Never been to a party before? You might want to check around with the others. People sometimes bring out special party favors.
Town.GuideSpecialText.Graveyard1,"Graveyards are spooky and very dangerous. I'd watch your step, kid."
Town.GuideSpecialText.Graveyard2,It's cold and ominous around here. I feel something very evil calling out to me.
Town.GuideSpecialText.Rain1,Be advised that certain creatures only come out during rain.
Town.GuideSpecialText.Rain2,"Don't be alarmed, it is just water. I hear certain species of fish can fly when it rains!"
Town.GuideSpecialText.Windy1,"Don't get blown away by the strong gusts going on, and be wary of monsters which take advantage of them!"
Town.GuideSpecialText.Windy2,It's windy out there! Now is the best time to fly a kite.
Town.GuideSpecialText.Storm1,"It's dangerous to be out in a thunderstorm. Take cover, kid."
Town.GuideSpecialText.Storm2,"Lightning is no joke, very powerful fiends come out in this weather."
Town.GuideSpecialText.SlimeRain,"If you defeat enough of these slimes, you might invoke the wrath of their king. Be careful!"
Town.GuideSpecialText.Eclipse,Huh?! Where is the sun? Why is it so dark? It must be a Solar Eclipse!
Town.GuideSpecialText.Lantern1,"What a beautiful night! With your recent victory, the world seems more at peace, and these lanterns are in celebration of that."
Town.GuideSpecialText.Lantern2,"Do you see the lanterns? Now that you've saved our world, there are regular celebrations of your victory. Always such a beautiful sight!"
Town.DemolitionistSpecialText.AfterDD2Start,I don't see why we can't just blow up those portals.
Town.DemolitionistSpecialText.Party,You might want to be careful today. Us dwarves tend to have pretty explosive parties.
Town.DemolitionistSpecialText.Graveyard1,The stench of death here is worse than the skeleton-infested caverns where I work!
Town.DemolitionistSpecialText.Graveyard2,All these piles of bones and stones... perfect for blowin' up!
Town.DemolitionistSpecialText.Windy1,"Now might not be the best time to lob grenades on the surface, my tall friend!"
Town.DemolitionistSpecialText.Windy2,"You want boomerang bombs? Throw some out in that gust, they'll come back to you alright!"
Town.DemolitionistSpecialText.Storm1,BOOM! Even mother nature likes a taste of gratifying demolition!
Town.DemolitionistSpecialText.Storm2,You shoulda seen it when lightning struck one of my carts filled with explosives!
Town.DemolitionistSpecialText.Rain1,This is a terrible day to be a dwarf.
Town.DemolitionistSpecialText.Rain2,ARGH! Another fuse put out by all this wet stuff! This never happens underground!
Town.ClothierSpecialText.Party,Mama always said you've got to put the past behind you before you can party on.
Town.ClothierSpecialText.Graveyard1,I've been cursed! Take me to the hospital!
Town.ClothierSpecialText.Graveyard2,"It's a big graveyard, we'll divide it up! The dead stay in their half, we'll stay in ours!"
Town.ClothierSpecialText.Windy1,"Sometimes, I guess there's just not enough windmills."
Town.ClothierSpecialText.Windy2,"The air has certainly got it, today!"
Town.ClothierSpecialText.Storm1,"Remember to keep breathing, because eventually this storm will pass!"
Town.ClothierSpecialText.Storm2,"If it wasn't storming, everyone would go outside. It's the lightning that makes it dangerous."
Town.ClothierSpecialText.Rain1,It's raining alright! Little bitty stingin' big ol' fat sideways rain! At least it ain't coming from straight up underneath us!
Town.ClothierSpecialText.Rain2,"One day it started raining like this, and it didn't quit for four days!"
Town.GoblinTinkererSpecialText.Party,"Goblin parties are a lot like humans. They both have games like ""Pin the Blame on the Human"" er... I don't play that game at my parties."
Town.GoblinTinkererSpecialText.Graveyard1,I'm working on a Photon Sack. It's an invention to trap all the ghasts lurking around outside!
Town.GoblinTinkererSpecialText.Graveyard2,The constant moaning and ear-piercing screeching noises are distracting me from my work!
Town.GoblinTinkererSpecialText.Windy1,This weather is the reason why I wear goggles! I can't have dirt and sand blowing in my eyes.
Town.GoblinTinkererSpecialText.Windy2,Now would be a great time to tinker a pinwheel accessory!
Town.GoblinTinkererSpecialText.Storm1,I'm working on an invention that will harness the energy being released around us!
Town.GoblinTinkererSpecialText.Storm2,Most goblins hate thunderstorms. Probably because they carry so many spiky balls.
Town.GoblinTinkererSpecialText.Rain1,All this rainfall makes it hard to see. I should tinker my goggles with a pair of windshield wipers.
Town.GoblinTinkererSpecialText.Rain2,"Humans are a lot taller than goblins. When it floods, we are always in big trouble!"
Town.WizardSpecialText.AfterDD2Tier1,"You know, I think I've seen a portal like that before, but it was gold."
Town.WizardSpecialText.Party,Clearly I throw the most magical of parties.
Town.WizardSpecialText.Graveyard1,"I can't bring anyone back from the dead, so don't ask!"
Town.WizardSpecialText.Graveyard2,"Funny, when I look far enough into the crystal ball, this is where every customer ends up!"
Town.WizardSpecialText.Windy1,This gale got you bothered? There's a spell for that.
Town.WizardSpecialText.Windy2,A blast of wind terrorizing our world? Did I do that?
Town.WizardSpecialText.Storm1,Did somebody steal my spell book again!?
Town.WizardSpecialText.Storm2,"You call this lightning!? Back in my day, I .. uh.. Hmm. Oh, did you need something?"
Town.WizardSpecialText.Rain1,"Yes, I can go out in the rain and not melt. I'm a wizard, dammit!"
Town.WizardSpecialText.Rain2,Raindrops falling on my... uh.. Where am I? Who are you? ... Who am I?
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsCursed1,Stay away! You are dragging a behemoth of woeful bad luck in your wake! I want nothing of it!!
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsCursed2,"Did you smash every mirror in WorldName!? You hapless fool, you are cursed beyond help!!"
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsTerrible1,I feel a terrible fate surrounding you! You should just stay in bed today!
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsTerrible2,What manner of salt did you spill to receive such misfortune!?
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsPoor1,Negative energy is seeping from your pores. I wouldn't take any chances today.
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsPoor2,"Unfortunate omens hang over your head. You DID forward that letter, right?"
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsBad1,The air feels dull and gloomy where you step. Be wary of ill feelings.
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsBad2,Is something bothering you? Something doesn't feel quite right about you.
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsGood1,"I sense a speck of good karma about you, but I could be mistaken."
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsGood2,"There's something unusually warm about you. I'm not sure how to place it, but keep walking in that direction."
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsGreat1,"You are giving off a positive energy, like something grand could occur at any moment."
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsGreat2,"There are vibes of good fortune emanating from you, as though your wishes could possibly come true."
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsAmazing1,Have you a garden of four-leaf clovers? You are bursting with essences of great fortune!
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsAmazing2,Serendipity smiles upon you! It is likely you shall find profit in all things!
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsGodly1,You are overflowing with a blessing of stupendous prosperity!!
Town.WizardSpecialText.LuckIsGodly2,Excessive health and happiness gush from your very being! You are a Godsend!!
Town.MechanicSpecialText.Party,Do you think anyone would mind if I wired a cake with bulbs instead of candles?
Town.MechanicSpecialText.Graveyard1,I should light up this dark and scary place to keep the monsters away.
Town.MechanicSpecialText.Graveyard2,"I'd run some wire here, but the spooky dead things are in the way!"
Town.MechanicSpecialText.Windy1,"Oh no! There are pockets of low pressure rolling in, I must secure the power grid."
Town.MechanicSpecialText.Windy2,My wires are getting tangled in this cyclone. Watch where you step!
Town.MechanicSpecialText.Storm1,Great! There goes another pump. When will the lightning stop frying my equipment?!
Town.MechanicSpecialText.Storm2,"Don't go outside right now while holding any of my products, you'll attract an unwanted dose of electrical power!"
Town.MechanicSpecialText.Rain1,"If it doesn't stop raining, my wrench is going to get all rusty!"
Town.MechanicSpecialText.Rain2,Oh Fudge! Shorted out another outlet! I hate this weather.
Town.TruffleSpecialText.Party,"I would have invited everyone to party in my home, but there's not mushroom."
Town.TruffleSpecialText.Graveyard1,This is an excellent place to start a family. Most of my friends were born here!
Town.TruffleSpecialText.Graveyard2,This place makes me feel good. I'm not sure why...
Town.TruffleSpecialText.Windy1,"Our kind is very brittle, I worry for my brothers on this breezy day."
Town.TruffleSpecialText.Windy2,"Wind is not my friend, I like the dark, calm places."
Town.TruffleSpecialText.Storm1,"The weather seems detrimental to your species, human."
Town.TruffleSpecialText.Storm2,That last roar of thunder startled the spores right out of me!
Town.TruffleSpecialText.Rain1,Ahh... nice and damp. I feel so good.
Town.TruffleSpecialText.Rain2,Rain is cause for celebration for my people.
Town.SteampunkerSpecialText.Party,"Everyone said they like stacked cakes, so I installed smokestacks in mine"
Town.SteampunkerSpecialText.Graveyard1,Golly! What uncultured swine decided to break ground here?
Town.SteampunkerSpecialText.Graveyard2,Neither blood nor steam pumps in this miserable locale.
Town.SteampunkerSpecialText.Windy1,Ahh... a sip of tea to enjoy the breeze.
Town.SteampunkerSpecialText.Windy2,"Why, this windy phenomena has inspired me ideas for a new jetpack engine!"
Town.SteampunkerSpecialText.Storm1,Electricity? Don't be ludicrous! Nothing beats the power of steam!
Town.SteampunkerSpecialText.Storm2,Everything I tinker up is made of metal. This current situation surely is a cause for rethinking that!
Town.SteampunkerSpecialText.Rain1,"The rain is a double edged sword you see... It provides us water for steam, but it also rusts our equipment."
Town.SteampunkerSpecialText.Rain2,This bloody downpour! I can't get a lick of anything done when it's all wet!
Town.DyeTraderSpecialText.HasPlant_0,"Brilliant, my dear! You have brought me an exquisite sample of the world's beautiful colors and aroma. In exchange, you may take this special bottle of dye."
Town.DyeTraderSpecialText.HasPlant_1,"You bring me a beautiful, rare flower... yes, yes? Take this bottle of special dye for your troubles, friend!"
Town.DyeTraderSpecialText.HasPlant_2,"Fantabulous, wonderful friend! With this delicate specimen, I may mix the most amazing dyes {WorldName} has ever seen! You may take this one right away!"
Town.DyeTraderSpecialText.NoPlant_0,"Oh no no, this will not do.  For these money is no good, you must return to me with a rare specimen of a plant!"
Town.DyeTraderSpecialText.NoPlant_1,"You think you can pull a fast one on {DyeTrader}, I don't think so! I only take the rarest of flowers for these special bottles!"
Town.DyeTraderSpecialText.NoPlant_2,"These dye bottles? Sorry dear friend, these don't take coin. I only take the most precious and rare of flora in exchange for one of this!"
Town.DyeTraderSpecialText.Party,"I truly love parties, so many beautiful colors and happy people."
Town.DyeTraderSpecialText.Graveyard1,"My, my... this is no good. The putrid surroundings are dulling my dye petals."
Town.DyeTraderSpecialText.Graveyard2,"You think this a place worthy of my presence? So drab, so dull, these people are literally below me."
Town.DyeTraderSpecialText.Windy1,Marvelous! The wind brings me petals of all colors!
Town.DyeTraderSpecialText.Windy2,"Give me a moment, my dear. I must secure my palette from the gusty gales!"
Town.DyeTraderSpecialText.Storm1,Egads! I loathe these bothersome storms!
Town.DyeTraderSpecialText.Storm2,"Please, do tell when the wrath of nature has ended out there!"
Town.DyeTraderSpecialText.Rain1,"Too much water dilutes my selection! This rain better pass, soon!"
Town.DyeTraderSpecialText.Rain2,"No, no, these robes cannot get wet! They will lose their vibrant color!"
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.AfterDD2Tier1,Have you seen an ogre yet? I want to ride on the back of one!
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Party_1,"Hmm? Nothing special today... just kidding! It's party time, and then it's after party time!"
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Party_2,"At last, my time has come!"
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Graveyard1,"Woo hoo! It's party time! ...Uh, why isn't anyone moving?"
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Graveyard2,We should party so loud that we LITERALLY wake the dead! Hee hee!
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Windy1,Did somebody say hurricane party!? I'll bring the batteries!
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Windy2,"This is like, an amazing time to fling confetti everywhere!"
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Storm1,"There was a sudden crash of thunder at the disco, and I panicked!"
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Storm2,Let's dance! We can shake our hips to the beat of the sky!
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Rain1,It's raining outside! Come on in and party!
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Rain2,"Oh, are you all wet? Well, shake it off!"
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Cake1,"Where ya been!? There's a total party going on! Here, take the cake!"
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Cake2,Shhh! Don't tell ANYONE I gave you this! It's a party surprise!
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Cake3,"Party up! You're like, in charge of the cake, {PlayerName}!"
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Music1,Are the tunes killing your party? I'll shuffle the playlist for you.
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Music2,I think this party could use a switch-up! How about these jams?
Town.PartyGirlSpecialText.Music3,We've been partying to this song for years! Let's change it up!
Town.CyborgSpecialText.Party,"This party is going to be nuts, maybe even bolts!"
Town.CyborgSpecialText.Graveyard1,Fascinating. This appears to be a storage unit for broken and malfunctioning humans.
Town.CyborgSpecialText.Graveyard2,My sensors indicate an increased density of energy particles. My visual receptors are unable to identify any of them.
Town.CyborgSpecialText.Windy1,Sensors indicate strong shifts in barometric pressure. Caution is advised.
Town.CyborgSpecialText.Windy2,A strong contrast between high and low pressure detected.
Town.CyborgSpecialText.Storm1,"BEEP! Severe weather warning. This is not a test. Take shelter, immediately. BEEP!"
Town.CyborgSpecialText.Storm2,Abnormal levels of negative and positive charged particles detected.
Town.CyborgSpecialText.Rain1,Precipitation detected. Advising self to seek shelter. Rust imminent.
Town.CyborgSpecialText.Rain2,Flash flood warning. Error 404: Sandbags not found.
Town.PainterSpecialText.Party,"I tried having a paintball fight, but everyone wanted food and decorations instead."
Town.PainterSpecialText.Graveyard1,"I paint walls and furniture, not bones! It isn't Dia de Muertos!"
Town.PainterSpecialText.Graveyard2,"What a dreary place... it sure could use a splash of color, huh?"
Town.PainterSpecialText.Windy1,Feel that draft coming through? It's wafting paint fumes all over the place.
Town.PainterSpecialText.Windy2,This wind storm just blew all the fresh paint right off the wall!
Town.PainterSpecialText.Storm1,"When the thunder rolls, and the lightning strikes... it really brings out the colors on the furniture."
Town.PainterSpecialText.Storm2,Blink and you'll miss it. The brightest colors stand out when the lightning flashes.
Town.PainterSpecialText.Rain1,Rain is my worst nightmare. It literally rinses out all my hard work!
Town.PainterSpecialText.Rain2,I painted a mural on this wall just a moment ago. Shoulda bought a weather radio!
Town.WitchDoctorSpecialText.AfterDD2Tier1,"I sense a kindred spirit in the Etherian Dark Mages. A pity they are our enemies, I would have liked to learn from them."
Town.WitchDoctorSpecialText.Party,"I wanted to see how your kind celebrate, I am not disappointed."
Town.WitchDoctorSpecialText.Graveyard1,"Rise, zombie! Zombie, arise!"
Town.WitchDoctorSpecialText.Graveyard2,"You may remove the reaper from the cemetery, but you may not remove the cemetery from the reaper..."
Town.WitchDoctorSpecialText.Rain1,The sound of rain is soothing to the soul.
Town.WitchDoctorSpecialText.Rain2,"Balance is key. We need sun, we need rain. Too much of either leads to ruin."
Town.WitchDoctorSpecialText.Windy1,"Keep your talismans close... if you wind some, you lose some."
Town.WitchDoctorSpecialText.Windy2,"The wind blows with the leaves, the leaves blow with the wind."
Town.WitchDoctorSpecialText.Storm1,"The spirits sound loudly this day, in blinding majesty."
Town.WitchDoctorSpecialText.Storm2,"Lightning casts powerful shadows, shadows cast powerful lightning."
Town.PirateSpecialText.Party,"After all that cake, you might have to call me White Beard for a while."
Town.PirateSpecialText.Graveyard1,"Arr... hate to say it, but many me mateys put these holes in the ground... if ye catch me drift!"

Town.StylistSpecialText.Graveyard2,"I kinda want to go out there and collect heads of hair for wigs, but I kinda don't want to GO OUT THERE!"
Town.StylistSpecialText.Windy1,"Want windswept hair? Go outside, it's free."
Town.StylistSpecialText.Windy2,"Ugh! I should just take the day off, this wind will blow away all my hard work!"
Town.StylistSpecialText.Storm1,I'm staying inside! The Einstein look is NOT in fashion.
Town.StylistSpecialText.Storm2,"Like, really? This crazy storm is bad for business!"
Town.StylistSpecialText.Rain1,That totally will not do. Soggy rat is not a hairstyle!
Town.StylistSpecialText.Rain2,What?! It's raining? I just got a perm!
Town.AnglerSpecialText.Party,"What, you think I like parties because I am a kid? Well, you're right, so get to partying!"
Town.AnglerSpecialText.Graveyard1,I'm totally scared right now! It is all YOUR fault!
Town.AnglerSpecialText.Graveyard2,"How can I fish out there?! Are you crazy, or just stupid!?"
Town.AnglerSpecialText.Windy1,"Wind is usually a great time to fish, but this is too much! I almost hooked my eye out!"
Town.AnglerSpecialText.Windy2,Is this some kinda hurricane!? I almost got hit by a dolphin!
Town.AnglerSpecialText.Storm1,Thunderstorms are the best time to go fishing! Also the most dangerous! That's why I'll send you to do it for me!
Town.AnglerSpecialText.Storm2,"This one time at fishing camp, lightning struck the lake! Suddenly, all the fish floated up to the surface for free!"
Town.AnglerSpecialText.Rain1,Yes! It's raining! Now I can watch you get soaking wet while you fish for me!
Town.AnglerSpecialText.Rain2,I always go fishing in the rain! It's why I wear this hat!

Town.TaxCollectorSpecialText.Graveyard1,"Death and taxes, nothing more sure in life than that!"
Town.TaxCollectorSpecialText.Graveyard2,"The people here aren't paying up! They are better off dead! Oh, perhaps they already are."
Town.TaxCollectorSpecialText.Windy1,"Just because your house blows down, doesn't mean you stop paying taxes!"
Town.TaxCollectorSpecialText.Windy2,"Bah! If this wind keeps up, people will lose their precious possessions and stop paying me!"
Town.TaxCollectorSpecialText.Storm1,A marvelous storm! A remarkable storm!
Town.TaxCollectorSpecialText.Storm2,I am as giddy as a drunken man! I love this weather!
Town.TaxCollectorSpecialText.Rain1,Humbug! Someone tried to tell me they saw a fish walking on land. Who do they take ME for?!
Town.TaxCollectorSpecialText.Rain2,"Why can't it be raining gold coins!? Water is everywhere! Bah, how useless!"
Town.BartenderSpecialText.FirstHelp,"For starters, take a few of these Defender Medals, on the house! I've got some special defenses you can purchase, but only with Defender Medals!"
Town.BartenderSpecialText.FirstMeeting,Huh? How did I get here? The last thing I remember was a portal opening up in front of me...
Town.BartenderSpecialText.BeforeDD2Tier1,We should really do something about the Old One's Army. Ask me about the Eternia Crystal if you want to learn more.
Town.BartenderSpecialText.AfterDD2Tier1,"Great job on fighting off the Old One's Army! But I'm sure we haven't seen the last of them, they didn't put up much of a fight this time."
Town.BartenderSpecialText.AfterDD2Tier2,"The Army of the Old One's keeps getting stronger, yet you keep pushing them back! But something tells me they aren't quite finished with us yet."
Town.BartenderSpecialText.AfterDD2Tier3,You really kept the full force of the Old One's Army at bay? Maybe you should visit Etheria some time.
Town.BartenderSpecialText.Party_1,"There's a party happening here! I had just wiped down the bar, too."
Town.BartenderSpecialText.Party_2,"You should sit down and have a little fun. Don't worry, I don't think any kobolds will crash this party."
Town.BartenderSpecialText.Graveyard1,"Etheria has some dark places, but this takes the cake!"
Town.BartenderSpecialText.Graveyard2,"The bar seems kinda dead tonight. Smells like it, too!"
Town.BartenderSpecialText.Windy1,There goes the roof. I had just had it redone yesterday!
Town.BartenderSpecialText.Windy2,"Hold onto your bonnet, there's a real breeze out today."
Town.BartenderSpecialText.Storm1,Take shelter from the storm! Sit down for a pint.
Town.BartenderSpecialText.Storm2,You look a bit frazzled! Perhaps a mug'll calm your singed nerves.
Town.BartenderSpecialText.Rain1,"You look like a drowned, shaggy dog! How 'bout you down some ale, eh?"
Town.BartenderSpecialText.Rain2,"Wipe your feet before you step in here, the floor was just waxed!"
Town.GolferSpecialText.FirstMeeting1,"Thank you for the rescue. If I were trapped out here any longer, I could have come down with a heat stroke!"
Town.GolferSpecialText.FirstMeeting2,"Why, thank you! I've been stuck in this sand pit for days. Good thing you can get water out of a cactus."
Town.GolferSpecialText.Party_1,I'm having trouble concentrating on this swing because of the obnoxious party going on around me.
Town.GolferSpecialText.Party_2,I hit a hole in one! That's a good reason for us all to celebrate. Time to put my club down and have a margarita.
Town.GolferSpecialText.Graveyard1,Graveyards creep me out. I don't like practicing my swings on top of my family and friends.
Town.GolferSpecialText.Graveyard2,Don't play golf in a cemetery. The grass grows too efficiently and makes the entire course rough.
Town.GolferSpecialText.Windy1,This wind makes for a very difficult course.
Town.GolferSpecialText.Windy2,"A strong gale adds challenge to a game of golf, but this is rather excessive."
Town.GolferSpecialText.Storm1,"I don't think so, {PlayerName}."
Town.GolferSpecialText.Storm2,The odds of being struck by lightning are the same as the lottery. Going outside swinging an iron is a winning ticket!
Town.GolferSpecialText.Rain1,Golfing in the rain is less fun. Everything is all slippery!
Town.GolferSpecialText.Rain2,"Water hazards are a lot larger when it rains, making it that much harder to reach the green!"
Town.PrincessSpecialText.Party,A party? Like.. a festival? I LOVE FESTIVALS! So much pink! So much glitter! It's so cheerful!!
Town.PrincessSpecialText.Graveyard1,Um... it's kind of scary out there. I better have some tea.
Town.PrincessSpecialText.Graveyard2,"What was that noise? Hm, perhaps I shouldn't worry so!"
Town.PrincessSpecialText.Windy1,"Oops! I better hold on to my tiara, it's rather blustery out today!"
Town.PrincessSpecialText.Windy2,"It surely is a swell day to fly a kite, don't you agree?"
Town.PrincessSpecialText.Storm1,Um... the storms outside sound pretty intense. I do appreciate the chaos.
Town.PrincessSpecialText.Storm2,"Do be careful if traveling outside, it's storming quite hard!"
Town.PrincessSpecialText.Rain1,There's something about the rain that makes me feel so calm.
Town.PrincessSpecialText.Rain2,I love it when it rains. It's soothing.
Town.SantaSpecialText.Party,"Come now, you didn't think I only celebrated on Christmas did you?"
Town.SantaSpecialText.Graveyard1,"Ho ho ho! Wait, look at this place... did I come two months too early!?"
Town.SantaSpecialText.Graveyard2,"Naughty or Nice? Hm, how unusual... the people here have all been crossed off my list for some time now."
Town.SantaSpecialText.Windy1,"Ho ho! My reindeer will fly at mach speeds, tonight!"
Town.SantaSpecialText.Storm1,"Oh ho... whoah! There goes Dasher. There went Donner, too!"
Town.SantaSpecialText.Rain1,"Got a torch? If so, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?!"
Town.TravellingMerchantSpecialText.Party,Many say that parties give you the richest of memories. So buy something and make this memory rich!
Town.TravellingMerchantSpecialText.Graveyard1,"Whew! Look at my many wares! I totally did NOT take them off the dead buried here, to sell to you."
Town.TravellingMerchantSpecialText.Graveyard2,"In my travels, I've never run across anyone living in a dismal place like this! Ah, well, as long as you have coin..."
Town.TravellingMerchantSpecialText.Windy1,"I go where winds take me, but this is ridiculous!"
Town.TravellingMerchantSpecialText.Windy2,"I would sell you exotic wind socks, but I'm afraid I forgot to stock them!"
Town.TravellingMerchantSpecialText.Storm1,Hurry up and buy!
Town.TravellingMerchantSpecialText.Storm2,Whew! That was close! Brick and mortar sounds like a pretty good investment right now.
Town.TravellingMerchantSpecialText.Rain1,"Rain or blue skies, I come from afar to serve you! Do you have some coin?"
Town.TravellingMerchantSpecialText.Rain2,"If my exotic coat shrinks, I will be a tad upset!"
Town.SkeletonMerchantSpecialText.Graveyard1,"As much as you would think I'd belong here, I really don't."
Town.SkeletonMerchantSpecialText.Graveyard2,How did I get here!? These are not my friends!
Town.SkeletonMerchantSpecialText.Windy1,"The world above is turbulent and chaotic. I like my bones to stay attached, as it were!"
Town.SkeletonMerchantSpecialText.Storm1,The surface is overabundant with destructive weather. Singed bones would be bad for my complexion!
Town.SkeletonMerchantSpecialText.Rain1,Up there? Heard it's pretty wet. Don't want my bones getting soggy and mushy...
Town.GolferQuestsChatterMaster.1,You are a God walking among mere mortals! A spectacular golfer!
Town.GolferQuestsChatterMaster.2,"If I had a trophy to give for your amazing swings, I'd give you ten!"
Town.GolferQuestsChatterMaster.3,"What a breathtaking golfer! You may be at the top, but never stop reaching for it!"
Town.GolferQuestsChatterJourneyman.1,"I'm impressed. Statistically, you are a wedge above the rest!"
Town.GolferQuestsChatterJourneyman.2,You're doing a good job out there! Should I be worried?
Town.GolferQuestsChatterJourneyman.3,Your courses are well below par. That's a good thing!
Town.GolferQuestsChatterApprentice.1,You're getting better! I am not fearing for my life anymore.
Town.GolferQuestsChatterApprentice.2,"Those are rather mediocre swings. Almost par for the course, if I must say."
Town.GolferQuestsChatterApprentice.3,"Not quite champion level, but you'll do."
Town.GolferQuestsChatterBeginner.1,"If you keep swinging like that, you'll end up hurting someone... or yourself!"
Town.GolferQuestsChatterBeginner.2,"You're going to need a lot of practice, I strongly recommend padding."
Town.GolferQuestsChatterBeginner.3,"That poor bird. Duck is tasty, however, so don't give up!"
